# Classical and Kernel Logistic Regression


##### Classical Logistic Regression [code](https://github.com/kennedyCzar/ADVANCE-MACHINE-LEARNING-KERNEL-METHOD/blob/master/LOGISTIC%20REGRESSION/losgisticRegression.py) | Kernel Version [code](https://github.com/kennedyCzar/ADVANCE-MACHINE-LEARNING-KERNEL-METHOD/blob/master/LOGISTIC%20REGRESSION/KERNEL%20LOGISTIC%20REGRESSION/kernellogistic.py)
##### Logistic regression is a linear binary classification algorithm frequently used for classification problems. We implemented losgistic regression using gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent and compare to kernel losgistic regression.
