##### Perceptrons, the simplest form of neural network, are parametric nonlinear function approximators f(x; 0; ) used for classification and regression purpose. The algorithm, originally inspired by neuronal circuits in the brain. Neuron activities in the brain is responsible for reflexes and problem solving intelligence, including but not limited to navigation, planning, object recognition, visual and speech perception.
