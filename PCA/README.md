# Classical and Kernel Principal Component Analysis (PCA)


##### Classical PCA [code](https://github.com/kennedyCzar/ADVANCE-MACHINE-LEARNING-KERNEL-METHOD/blob/master/PCA/PCA.py) | Kernel PCA [code](https://github.com/kennedyCzar/ADVANCE-MACHINE-LEARNING-KERNEL-METHOD/blob/master/PCA/KERNEL%20PCA/KPCA.py)
##### Principal Component Analysis is a dimension reduction technique (or data compression technique), used for reducing the dimension of a dataset from a higher dimensional space to a lower dimensional subspace by leveraging the linear dependence between features.
