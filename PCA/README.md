# Classical and Kernel Principal Component Analysis (PCA)


##### Classical Logistic Regression [code](https://github.com/kennedyCzar/ADVANCE-MACHINE-LEARNING-KERNEL-METHOD/blob/master/LOGISTIC%20REGRESSION/losgisticRegression.py) | Kernel Version [code](https://github.com/kennedyCzar/ADVANCE-MACHINE-LEARNING-KERNEL-METHOD/blob/master/LOGISTIC%20REGRESSION/KERNEL%20LOGISTIC%20REGRESSION/kernellogistic.py)
##### Principal Component Analysis is a dimension reduction technique (or data compression technique), used for reducing the dimension of a dataset from a higher dimensional space to a lower dimensional subspace by leveraging the linearly dependence between features.
