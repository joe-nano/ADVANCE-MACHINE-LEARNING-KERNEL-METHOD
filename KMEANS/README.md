# Classical and kernel KMeans


##### Classical KMeans [code](https://github.com/kennedyCzar/ADVANCE-MACHINE-LEARNING-KERNEL-METHOD/blob/master/KMEANS/kmeans.py) | Kernel Version [code](https://github.com/kennedyCzar/ADVANCE-MACHINE-LEARNING-KERNEL-METHOD/blob/master/KMEANS/KERNEL%20KMEANS/kernelkmeans.py)
##### Kmeans is an unsupervised algorithm for clustering datasets. Its classic form is only suitable for linearly seperable data while its kernel version is suitable for both linear and non-linearly seperable datasets.
